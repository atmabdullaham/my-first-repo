          MI phomes are the best qualitiy phones.It the brand with minimum price
          with their dedicaded quality.Bangladesi people always wants to buy a
          phone with big screen. And they want to the better camera quality and
          maximum bettery backup. MI produced all of them in their phones with
          reasonable price. so, we like mi phones. In our family, all smartphone
          user use the mi phone. Base on their customer there are lack of
          customer oriented service. It is a negative side of xiomi bangladesh.
          Besides The customer care authorized by xiomi sometimes on behalf of
          frude while they change the bettery when it is disqualified. Besides
          all other customer service are good.

        <h1>SAMSUNG</h1>
        <p>
          Samsung is also a well known brand in Bangladesi. All kinds of people
          like samsung as a brand. The prblem is smmetimes it offered their
          phones with high price. It is disgusting. The middle class family and
          upper middle class family used the phone with their crazyness. I
          apprectiate the coumpanie with their best quality and availability.
          They designed some feature phones which also famous for their branding
          and marketing power and sometimes it react like monopoly. In monopoly
          market their are most of the case full market is captured by one
          seller. One features of this kind of market is, they produce small
          amount of product and they fixed the higher comparatively from
          monopolistic market, Competitive market and oligopoly market.
          Sometimes monopoly is very good for society because in this market
          their are so many opportunity to innovation and apply immediately to
          society.
